# Portfolio - TETW Stack

Welcome to my portfolio using the shortest stack out there. This stack combines TailwindCSS 2.0, Eleventy, Turbolinks and Webpack to make static site.

## Tech

- TailwindCSS: Easy to use utility-first CSS framework
- Eleventy: A simpler static site generator
- Turbo: SPA performance on a SSR Website
- Webpack: Bundler of assets

## Features

- Auto generate icon webfonts from SVG files.
- Purge of CSS files
- Minify of HTML/CSS/JS
- GraphQL requests
- SEO optimized

## Getting Started

Just run the usual commands and peep the `package.json` file to see the available scripts and packages.

For the lazy:

- `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `npm run dev` to boot up that dev server and start building
- `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site!
